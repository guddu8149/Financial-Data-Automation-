# Financial-Data-Automation-
This Python project automates the processing of large financial datasets, performs variance analysis, and generates comprehensive regulatory reports. The tool is designed to improve efficiency and reduce manual efforts by up to 40%.
the process it follows:

Simulates a Financial Dataset:

Creates a daily dataset with random values for revenue, expenses, and budgeted amounts.
Saves the simulated dataset as a CSV file.
Loads the Data:

Reads the financial data from the CSV file into a DataFrame.
Processes the Data:

Calculates total revenue and total expenses.
Conducts Variance Analysis:

Computes the difference between actual and budgeted revenue and expenses.
Generates a Regulatory Report:

Summarizes the financial performance, including total revenue, total expenses, and variances.
Evaluates whether the revenue and expenses met the budget.
Measures Automation Efficiency:

Tracks the time taken for the entire process.
